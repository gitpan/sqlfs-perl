DBI::Filesystem - Store a filesystem in a relational database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use DBI::Filesystem;

 # Preliminaries. Create the mount point:
 mkdir '/tmp/mount';

 # Create the databas:
 system "mysqladmin -uroot create test_filesystem"; 
 system "mysql -uroot -e 'grant all privileges on test_filesystem.* to $ENV{USER}@localhost' mysql";

 # (Usually you would do this in the shell.)
 # (You will probably need to add the admin user's password)

 # Create the filesystem object
 $fs = DBI::Filesystem->new('dbi:mysql:test_filesystem',{initialize=>1});

 # Mount it on the mount point.
 # This call will block until the filesystem is mounted by another
 # process by calling "fusermount -u /tmp/mount"
 $fs->mount('/tmp/mount');

 # Alternatively, manipulate the filesystem directly from within Perl.
 # Any of these methods could raise a fatal error, so always wrap in
 # an eval to catch those errors.
 eval {
   # directory creation
   $fs->create_directory('/dir1');
   $fs->create_directory('/dir1/subdir_1a');

   # file creation
   $fs->create_file('/dir1/subdir_1a/test.txt');

   # file I/O
   $fs->write('/dir1/subdir_1a/test.txt','This is my favorite file',0);
   my $data = $fs->read('/dir1/subdir_1a/test.txt',100,0);

   # reading contents of a directory
   my @entries = $fs->getdir('/dir1');

   # fstat file/directory
   my @stat = $fs->stat('/dir1/subdir_1a/test.txt');

   #chmod/chown file
   $fs->chmod('/dir1/subdir_1a/test.txt',0600);
   $fs->chown('/dir1/subdir_1a/test.txt',1001,1001); #uid,gid

   # rename file/directory
   $fs->rename('/dir1'=>'/dir2');

   # create a symbolic link
   $fs->symlink('/dir2' => '/dir1');

   # create a hard link
   $fs->link('/dir2/subdir_1a/test.txt' => '/dir2/hardlink.txt');

   # read symbolic link
   my $target = $fs->read_symlink('/dir1/symlink.txt');

   # unlink a file
   $fs->unlink_file('/dir2/subdir_1a/test.txt');

   # remove a directory
   $fs->remove_directory('/dir2/subdir_1a');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module can be used to create a fully-functioning "Fuse" userspace
filesystem on top of a relational database. Unlike other
filesystem-to-DBM mappings, such as Fuse::DBI, this one creates and
manages a specific schema designed to support filesystem
operations. If you wish to mount a filesystem on an arbitrary DBM
schema, you probably want Fuse::DBI, not this.

Most filesystem functionality is implemented, including hard and soft
links, sparse files, ownership and access modes, UNIX permission
checking and random access to binary files. Very large files (up to
multiple gigabytes) are supported without performance degradation.

Why would you use this? The main reason is that it allows you to use
DBMs functionality such as accessibility over the network, database
replication, failover, etc. In addition, the underlying
DBI::Filesystem module can be extended via subclassing to allow
additional functionality such as arbitrary access control rules,
searchable file and directory metadata, full-text indexing of file
contents, etc.

Before mounting the DBMS, you must have created the database and
assigned yourself sufficient privileges to read and write to it. You
must also create an empty directory to serve as the mount point.

A convenient front-end to this library is provided by B<sqlfs.pl>,
which is installed along with this library.

=head2 Unsupported Features

The following features are not implemented:

 * statfs -- df on the filesystem will not provide any useful information
            on free space or other filesystem information.

 * extended attributes -- Extended attributes are not supported.

 * nanosecond times -- atime, mtime and ctime are accurate only to the
            second.

 * ioctl -- none are supported

 * poll  -- polling on the filesystem to detect file update events will not work.

 * lock  -- file handle locking among processes running on the local machine 
            works, but protocol-level locking, which would allow cooperative 
            locks on different machines talking to the same database server, 
            is not implemented.

You must be the superuser in order to create a file system with the
suid and dev features enabled, and must invoke this commmand with
the mount options "allow_other", "suid" and/or "dev":

   -o dev,suid,allow_other

=head2 Supported Database Management Systems

DBMSs differ in what subsets of the SQL language they support,
supported datatypes, date/time handling, and support for large binary
objects. DBI::Filesystem currently supports MySQL, PostgreSQL and
SQLite. Other DBMSs can be supported by creating a subclass file
named, e.g. DBI::Filesystem:Oracle, where the last part of the class
name corresponds to the DBD driver name ("Oracle" in this
example). See DBI::Filesystem::SQLite, DBI::Filesystem::mysql and
DBI::Filesystem:Pg for an illustration of the methods that need to be
defined/overridden.

=head2 Fuse Installation Notes

For best performance, you will need to run this filesystem using a
version of Perl that supports IThreads. Otherwise it will fall back to
non-threaded mode, which will introduce occasional delays during
directory listings and have notably slower performance when reading
from more than one file simultaneously.

If you are running Perl 5.14 or higher, you *MUST* use at least 0.15
of the Perl Fuse module. At the time this was written, the version of
Fuse 0.15 on CPAN was failing its regression tests on many
platforms. I have found that the easiest way to get a fully
operational Fuse module is to clone and compile a patched version of
the source, following this recipe:

 $ git clone git://github.com/dpavlin/perl-fuse.git
 $ cd perl-fuse
 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make test   (optional)
 $ sudo make install

=head2 $fs = DBI::Filesystem->new($dsn,{options...})

Create the new DBI::Filesystem object. The mandatory first argument is
a DBI data source, in the format "dbi:<driver>:<other_arguments>". The
other arguments may include the database name, host, port, and
security credentials. See the documentation for your DBMS for details.

Non-mandatory options are contained in a hash reference with one or
more of the following keys:

 initialize          If true, then initialize the database schema. Many
                     DBMSs require you to create the database first.

 ignore_permissions  If true, then Unix permission checking is not
                     performed when creating/reading/writing files.

WARNING: Initializing the schema quietly destroys anything that might
have been there before!

=head2 $fs->mount($mountpoint, [\%fuseopts])

This method will mount the filesystem on the indicated mountpoint
using Fuse and block until the filesystem is unmounted using the
"fusermount -u" command or equivalent. The mountpoint must be an empty
directory unless the "nonempty" mount option is passed.

You may pass in a hashref of options to pass to the Fuse
module. Recognized options and their defaults are:

 debug        Turn on verbose debugging of Fuse operations [false]
 threaded     Turn on threaded operations [true]
 nullpath_ok  Allow filehandles on open files to be used even after file
               is unlinked [true]
 mountopts    Comma-separated list of mount options

Mount options to be passed to Fuse are described at
http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man8/mount.fuse.8.html. In
addition, you may pass the usual mount options such as "ro", etc. They
are presented as a comma-separated list as shown here:

 $fs->mount('/tmp/foo',{debug=>1,mountopts=>'ro,nonempty'})

Common mount options include:

Fuse specific
 nonempty      Allow mounting over non-empty directories if true [false]
 allow_other   Allow other users to access the mounted filesystem [false]
 fsname        Set the filesystem source name shown in df and /etc/mtab
 auto_cache    Enable automatic flushing of data cache on open [false]
 hard_remove   Allow true unlinking of open files [true]
 nohard_remove Activate alternate semantics for unlinking open files
                (see below)

General
 ro          Read-only filesystem
 dev         Allow device-special files
 nodev       Do not allow device-special files
 suid        Allow suid files
 nosuid      Do not allow suid files
 exec        Allow executable files
 noexec      Do not allow executable files
 atime       Update file/directory access times
 noatime     Do not update file/directory access times

Some options require special privileges. In particular allow_other
must be enabled in /etc/fuse.conf, and the dev and suid options can
only be used by the root user.

The "hard_remove" mount option is passed by default. This option
allows files to be unlinked in one process while another process holds
an open filehandle on them. The contents of the file will not actually
be deleted until the last open filehandle is closed. The downside of
this is that certain functions will fail when called on filehandles
connected to unlinked files, including fstat(), ftruncate(), chmod(),
and chown(). If this is an issue, then pass option
"nohard_remove". This will activate Fuse's alternative semantic in
which unlinked open files are renamed to a hidden file with a name
like ".fuse_hiddenXXXXXXX'. The hidden file is removed when the last
filehandle is closed.

=head2 Fuse hook functions

This module defines a series of short hook functions that form the
glue between Fuse's function-oriented callback hooks and this module's
object-oriented methods. A typical hook function looks like this:

 sub e_getdir {
    my $path = fixup(shift);
    my @entries = eval {$Self->getdir($path)};
    return $Self->errno($@) if $@;
    return (@entries,0);
 }

The preferred naming convention is that the Fuse callback is named
"getdir", the function hook is named e_getdir(), and the method is
$fs->getdir(). The DBI::Filesystem object is stored in a singleton
global named $Self. The hook fixes up the path it receives from Fuse,
and then calls the getdir() method in an eval{} block. If the getdir()
method raises an error such as "file not found", the error message is
passed to the errno() method to turn into a ERRNO code, and this is
returned to the caller. Otherwise, the hook returns the results in the
format proscribed by Fuse.

If you are subclassing DBI::Filesystem, there is no need to define new
hook functions. All hooks described by Fuse are already defined or
generated dynamically as needed. Simply create a correctly-named
method in your subclass.

These are the hooks that are defined:

 e_getdir       e_open           e_access      e_unlink
 e_getattr      e_release        e_rename      e_rmdir
 e_fgetattr     e_flush          e_chmod       e_utime
 e_mkdir        e_read           e_chown
 e_mknod        e_write          e_symlink
 e_create       e_truncate       e_readlink

These hooks will be created as needed if a subclass implements the
corresponding methods:

 e_statfs       e_lock            e_init 
 e_fsync        e_opendir         e_destroy 
 e_setxattr     e_readdir         e_utimens
 e_getxattr     e_releasedir      e_bmap 
 e_listxattr    e_fsyncdir        e_ioctl 
 e_removexattr  e_poll

=head2 $inode = $fs->mknod($path,$mode,$rdev)

This method creates a file or special file (pipe, device file,
etc). The arguments are the path of the file to create, the mode of
the file, and the device number if creating a special device file, or
0 if not.  The return value is the inode of the newly-created file, an
unique integer ID, which is actually the primary key of the metadata
table in the underlying database.

The path in this, and all subsequent methods, is relative to the
mountpoint. For example, if the filesystem is mounted on /tmp/foobar,
and the file you wish to create is named /tmp/foobar/dir1/test.txt,
then pass "dir1/test.txt". You can also include a leading slash (as in
"/dir1/test.txt") which will simply be stripped off.

The mode is a bitwise combination of file type and access mode as
described for the st_mode field in the stat(2) man page. If you
provide just the access mode (e.g. 0666), then the method will
automatically set the file type bits to indicate that this is a
regular file. You must provide the file type in the mode in order to
create a special file.

The rdev field contains the major and minor device numbers for device
special files, and is only needed when creating a device special file
or pipe; ordinarily you can omit it. The rdev field is described in
stat(2).

Various exceptions can arise during this call including invalid paths,
permission errors and the attempt to create a duplicate file
name. These will be presented as fatal errors which can be trapped by
an eval {}. See $fs->errno() for a list of potential error messages.

Like other file-manipulation methods, this will die with a "permission
denied" message if the current user does not have sufficient
privileges to write into the desired directory. To disable permission
checking, set ignore_permissions() to a true value:

 $fs->ignore_permissions(1)

Unless explicitly provided, the mode will be set to 0100777 (all
permissions set).

=head2 $inode = $fs->mkdir($path,$mode)

Create a new directory with the specified path and mode and return the
inode of the newly created directory. The path and mode are the same
as those described for mknod(), except that the filetype bits for
$mode will be set to those for a directory if not provided. Like
mknod() this method may raise a fatal error, which should be trapped
by an eval{}.

Unless explicitly provided, the mode will be set to 0040777 (all
permissions set).

=head2 $fs->unlink($path)

Unlink the file or symlink located at $path. If this is the last
reference to the file (via hard links or filehandles) then the
contents of the file and its inode will be permanently removed. This

=head2 $fs->link($oldpath,$newpath)

Create a hard link from the file at $oldpath to $newpath. If an error
occurs the method will die. Note that this method will allow you to
create a hard link to directories as well as files. This is disallowed
by the "ln" command, and is generally a bad idea as you can create a
filesystem with path loops.

=head2 @entries = $fs->getdir($path)

Given a directory in $path, return a list of all entries (files,
directories) contained within that directory. The '.' and '..' paths
are also always returned. This method checks that the current user has
read and execute permissions on the directory, and will raise a
permission denied error if not (trap this with an eval{}).

=head2 $fs->chmod($path,$mode)

This method changes the access mode for the file or directory at the

=head2 @stat = $fs->fgetattr($path,$inode)

Return the 13-element file attribute list returned by Perl's stat()
function, describing an existing file or directory. You may pass the
path, and/or the inode of the file/directory. If both are passed, then
the inode takes precedence.

The returned list will contain:

   0 dev      device number of filesystem
   1 ino      inode number
   2 mode     file mode  (type and permissions)
   3 nlink    number of (hard) links to the file
   4 uid      numeric user ID of file's owner
   5 gid      numeric group ID of file's owner
   6 rdev     the device identifier (special files only)
   7 size     total size of file, in bytes
   8 atime    last access time in seconds since the epoch
   9 mtime    last modify time in seconds since the epoch
  10 ctime    inode change time in seconds since the epoch (*)
  11 blksize  preferred block size for file system I/O
  12 blocks   actual number of blocks allocated

=head2 $inode = $fs->open($path,$flags,$info)

Open the file at $path and return its inode. $flags are a bitwise
OR-ing of the access mode constants including O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY,
O_RDWR, O_CREAT, and $info is a hash reference containing flags from
the Fuse module. The latter is currently ignored.

This method checks read/write permissions on the file and containing
directories, unless ignore_permissions is set to true. The open method
also increments the file's inuse counter, ensuring that even if it is
unlinked, its contents will not be removed until the last open
filehandle is closed.

The flag constants can be obtained from POSIX.

=cut

sub open {

count. Be careful to balance calls to open() with release(), or the
file will have an inconsistent use count.

=head2 $data = $fs->read($path,$length,$offset,$inode)

Read $length bytes of data from the file at $path, starting at
position $offset. You may optionally pass an inode to the method to
read from a previously-opened file.

On success, the requested data will be returned. Otherwise a fatal
exception will be raised (which can be trapped with an eval{}).

Note that you do not need to open the file before reading from
it. Permission checking is not performed in this call, but in the
(optional) open() call.

Write the data provided in $data into the file at $path, starting at

read from a previously-opened file.

On success, the number of bytes written will be returned. Otherwise a fatal
exception will be raised (which can be trapped with an eval{}).

Note that the file does not previously need to have been opened in
order to write to it, and permission checking is not performed at this
level. This checking is performed in the (optional) open() call.

=head2 $errno = $fs->errno($message)

Most methods defined by this module are called within an eval{} to
trap errors. On an error, the message contained in $@ is passed to
errno() to turn it into a UNIX error code. The error code is then
returned to the Fuse module.

The following is the limited set of mappings performed:

  Eval{} error message       Unix Errno   Context
  --------------------       ----------   -------

  not found                  ENOENT       Path lookups
  file exists                EEXIST       Path creation
  is a directory             EISDIR       Attempt to open/read/write a directory
  not a directory            ENOTDIR      Attempt to list entries from a file
  length beyond end of file  EINVAL       Truncate file to longer than current length
  not empty                  ENOTEMPTY    Attempt to remove a directory that is in use
  permission denied          EACCESS      Access modes don't allow requested operation

The full error message usually has further detailed information. For
example the full error message for "not found" is "$path not found"
where $path contains the requested path.

All other errors, including problems in the underlying DBI database
layer, result in an error code of EIO ("I/O error"). These constants
can be obtained from POSIX.

=head1 LOW LEVEL METHODS

The following methods may be of interest for those who wish to
understand how this module works, or want to subclass and extend this
module.

=cut

=head2 $fs->initialize_schema

This method is called to initialize the database schema. The database
must already exist and be writable by the current user. All previous
data will be deleted from the database.

The default schema contains three tables:

 metadata -- Information about the inode used for the stat() call. This
             includes its length, modification and access times, 
             permissions, and ownership. There is one row per inode,
             and the inode is the table's primary key.

 path     -- Maps paths to inodes. Each row is a distinct component
             of a path and contains the name of the component, the 
             inode of the parent component, and the inode corresponding
             to the component. This is illustrated below.

 extents  -- Maps inodes to the contents of the file. Each row consists
             of the inode of the file, the block number of the data, and
             a blob containing the data in that block.

For the mysql adapter, here is the current schema:

The B<metadata table> is straightforward. The meaning of most columns
can be inferred from the stat(2) manual page. The only columns that
may be mysterious are "links" and "inuse". "links" describes the
number of distinct paths involving a file or directory. Files start
out with one link and are incremented by one every time a hardlink is
created (symlinks don't count). Directories start out with two links
(one for '..' and the other for '.') and are incremented by one every
time a file or subdirectory is added to the directory. The "inuse"
column is incremented every time a file is opened for reading or
writing, and decremented when the file is closed. It is used to
prevent the content from being deleted if the file is still in use.

The B<path table> is organized to allow rapid translation from a pathname
to an inode. Each entry in the tree is identified by its inode, its
name, and the inode of its parent directory. The inode of the root "/"
node is hard-coded to 1. The following steps show the effect of
creating subdirectories and files on the path table:

After initial filesystem initialization there is only one entry
in paths corresponding to the root directory. The root has no parent:

 +-------+------+--------+
 | inode | name | parent |
 +-------+------+--------+
 |     1 | /    |   NULL |
 +-------+------+--------+

$ mkdir directory1
 +-------+------------+--------+
 | inode | name       | parent |
 +-------+------------+--------+
 |     1 | /          |   NULL |
 |     2 | directory1 |      1 |
 +-------+------------+--------+

$ mkdir directory1/subdir_1_1

 +-------+------------+--------+
 | inode | name       | parent |
 +-------+------------+--------+
 |     1 | /          |   NULL |
 |     2 | directory1 |      1 |
 |     3 | subdir_1_1 |      2 |
 +-------+------------+--------+

$ mkdir directory2

 +-------+------------+--------+
 | inode | name       | parent |
 +-------+------------+--------+
 |     1 | /          |   NULL |
 |     2 | directory1 |      1 |
 |     3 | subdir_1_1 |      2 |
 |     4 | directory2 |      1 |
 +-------+------------+--------+

$ touch directory2/file1.txt

 +-------+------------+--------+
 | inode | name       | parent |
 +-------+------------+--------+
 |     1 | /          |   NULL |
 |     2 | directory1 |      1 |
 |     3 | subdir_1_1 |      2 |
 |     4 | directory2 |      1 |
 |     5 | file1.txt  |      4 |
 +-------+------------+--------+

$ ln directory2/file1.txt link_to_file1.txt

 +-------+-------------------+--------+
 | inode | name              | parent |
 +-------+-------------------+--------+
 |     1 | /                 |   NULL |
 |     2 | directory1        |      1 |
 |     3 | subdir_1_1        |      2 |
 |     4 | directory2        |      1 |
 |     5 | file1.txt         |      4 |
 |     5 | link_to_file1.txt |      1 |
 +-------+-------------------+--------+

Notice in the last step how creating a hard link establishes a second
entry with the same inode as the original file, but with a different
name and parent.

The inode for path /directory2/file1.txt can be found with this
recursive-in-spirit SQL fragment:

 select inode from path where name="file1.txt" 
              and parent in 
                (select inode from path where name="directory2" 
                              and parent in
                                (select 1)
                )

The B<extents table> provides storage of file (and symlink)
contents. During testing, it turned out that storing the entire
contents of a file into a single BLOB column provided very poor random
access performance. So instead the contents are now broken into blocks
of constant size 4096 bytes. Each row of the table corresponds to the
inode of the file, the block number (starting at 0), and the data
contained within the block. In addition to dramatically better
read/write performance, this scheme allows sparse files (files
containing "holes") to be stored efficiently: Blocks that fall within
holes are completely absent from the table, while those that lead into
a hole are shorter than the full block length.

The logical length of the file is stored in the metadata length
column.

If you have subclassed DBI::Filesystem and wish to adjust the default
schema (such as adding indexes), this is the place to do it. Simply
call the inherited initialize_schema(), and then alter the tables as
you please.

=head2 $size = $fs->blocksize

This method returns the blocksize (currently 4096 bytes) used for
writing and retrieving file contents to the extents table. Because
4096 is a typical value used by libc, altering the value in subclasses
will probably degrade performance. Also be aware that altering the
blocksize will render filesystems created with other blocksize values
unreadable.

=cut

sub blocksize   { return 4096 }

=head2 $count = $fs->flushblocks

This method returns the maximum number of blocks of file contents data
that can be stored in memory before it is written to disk. Because all
blocks are written to the database in a single transaction, this can
have a dramatic performance effect and it is worth trying different
values when tuning the module for new DBMSs.

The default is 64.

=cut

sub flushblocks { return   64 }


=head2 $fixed_path = fixup($path)

This is an ordinary function (not a method!) that removes the initial
slash from paths passed to this module from Fuse. The root directory
(/) is not changed:

 Before      After fixup()
 ------      -------------
 /foo        foo
 /foo/bar    foo/bar
 /          /

To call this method from subclasses, invoke it as DBI::Filesystem::fixup().

=cut

sub fixup {
    my $path = shift;
    no warnings;
    $path    =~ s!^/!!;
    $path   || '/';
}

=head2 $dsn = $fs->dsn

This method returns the DBI data source passed to new(). It cannot be
changed.

=cut

sub dsn { shift->{dsn} }

=head2 $dbh = $fs->dbh

This method opens a connection to the database defined by dsn() and
returns the database handle (or raises a fatal exception). The
database handle will have its RaiseError and AutoCommit flags set to
true. Since the mount function is multithreaded, there will be one
database handle created per thread.

=cut

sub dbh {
    my $self = shift;
    my $dsn  = $self->dsn;
    return $self->{dbh} if $self->{dbh};

    $self->_dbh_init($dbh) if $self->can('_dbh_init');
    return $self->{dbh}=$dbh;
}

=head2 $inode = $fs->create_inode($type,$mode,$rdev,$uid,$gid)

This method creates a new inode in the database. An inode corresponds
to a file, directory, symlink, pipe or block special device, and has a
unique integer ID defining it as its primary key. Arguments are the
type of inode to create, which is used to check that the passed mode
is correct ('f'=file, 'd'=directory,'l'=symlink; anything else is
ignored), the mode of the inode, which is a combination of type and
access permissions as described in stat(2), the device ID if a special
file, and the desired UID and GID.

The return value is the newly-created inode ID.

You will ordinarily use the mknod() and mkdir() methods to create
files, directories and special files.

    return $self->last_inserted_inode($dbh);
}

=head2 $id = $fs->last_inserted_inode($dbh)

After a new inode is inserted into the database, this method returns
its ID. Unique inode IDs are generated using various combinations of
database autoincrement and sequence semantics, which vary from DBMS to
DBMS, so you may need to override this method in subclasses.

The default is simply to call DBI's last_insert_id method:

 $dbh->last_insert_id(undef,undef,undef,undef)

=cut

sub last_inserted_inode {
    my $self = shift;
    my $dbh  = shift;
    return $dbh->last_insert_id(undef,undef,undef,undef);

=head2 $self->create_path($inode,$path)

After creating an inode, you can associate it with a path in the
filesystem using this method. It will raise an error if unsuccessful.

    $self->touch($parent,'ctime');
    $self->touch($parent,'mtime');
}

=head2 $inode=$self->create_inode_and_path($path,$type,$mode,$rdev)

Create an inode and associate it with the indicated path, returning
the inode ID. Arguments are the path, the file type (one of 'd', 'f',
or 'l' for directory, file or symbolic link). As usual, this may exit
with a fatal error.

Given an inode, this deletes it and its contents, but only if the file
is no longer in use. It will die with an exception if the changes
cannot be committed to the database.

of the inode, the inode of the containing directory, and the basename
of the file.

This method does permission and access path checking, and will die
with a "permission denied" error if either check fails. In addition,
passing an invalid path will return a "path not found" error.

=head2 @paths = $fs->inode2paths($inode)

Given an inode, this method returns the path(s) that correspond to
it. There may be multiple paths since file inodes can have hard
links. In addition, there may be NO path corresponding to an inode, if
the file is open but all externally accessible links have been
unlinked.

Be aware that the B<path table> is indexed to make path to inode
searches fast, not the other way around. If you build a content search
engine on top of DBI::Filesystem and rely on this method, you may wish
to add an index to the path table's "inode" field.

=head2 $groups = $fs->get_groups($uid,$gid)

This method takes a UID and GID, and returns the primary and
supplemental groups to which the user is assigned, and is used during
permission checking. The result is a hashref in which the keys are the
groups to which the user belongs.

=head2 $ctx = $fs->get_context

This method is a wrapper around the fuse_get_context() function
described in L<Fuse>. If called before the filesystem is mounted, then
it fakes the call, returning a context object based on the information
in the current process.

	pid   => $$,
	umask => umask()

=head1 SUBCLASSING

Subclass this module as you ordinarily would by creating a new package
that has a "use base DBI::Filesystem". You can then tell the
command-line sqlfs.pl tool to load your subclass rather than the
original by providing a --module (or -M) option, as in:

 $ sqlfs.pl -MDBI::Filesystem::MyClass <database> <mtpt>
